- 👋 Hi, I’m @IcyBow... I mean I am actually not Icybow as you can imagine. But I like my privacy, so yeah my name is IcyBow.
- 👀 I’m interested in Health, Sports, Coding, Technology in general. I also used to play a lot of videogames but don't feel the same about them anymore, still happens that I spend some time on one though.
- 💞️ I actually never collaborated in an Open Source project, but I love Open Source and it is in my "bucket list".
- 📫 You can reach me anytime: [contact@icybow.com](mailto:contact@icybow.com)
